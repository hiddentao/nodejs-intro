This is an introduction to Node.js, building from basics through to using Express.JS and Socket.IO to build a simple chatroom application.

This workshop will be (or by now has been) given at the [Taipei Javascript Enthusiasts meetup](http://www.meetup.com/javascript-enthusiasts/events/127360132/)

## How to use

Each step of the workshop is in its own folder, starting from the very basics (step1) to forms, routes, websockets (step10 and beyond).

To run a step use `node index.js` in the step folder.

For steps which have a `package.json` file you will need to run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
